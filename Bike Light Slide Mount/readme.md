## BASIC INFORMATION
### Thing Name 
Bike light slide mount
### Category 
  Sport & Outdoors
### License 
Creative Commons - Attribution
### Tags
adapter, bicycle handlebar, Bicycle Light Mount, clip, cycling, flashlight mount, handlebar mount, light, mount


## Summary 
Couldn't find a mounting clip to fit this type of bike light which slides on so here it is. Light has a full metal construction including the clip, rest of the mounting system is plastic with nuts & bolts.

One I have is a Ocoopa KX3, could be sold under other names too.

I haven't needed to replace the handlebar clamping parts and loads exist already, this looks like it should just bolt on: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34385

Supports are required due to the opposing holes, you can get away with the bare minimum here using a tower in the middle with low infill.
