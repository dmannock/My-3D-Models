## BASIC INFORMATION
### Thing Name 
Insulation Load Spreading Retaining Washer

Insulation, plasterboard, washer, retaining clip, mount, fixing, load spreading, diy, building

## Summary 
Spread the load / increase fixing area when mounting insulation/plasterboard with screws. 60mm Diameter.

TIP: Print without supports by moving 1mm below the build plate (z-axis -1mm).

There is an additional 1mm deep notch on that side that faces to insulation, this adds even more support like most retaining clips. However, it becomes more difficult to print, so far I've never needed it. Printing at 0.2 or 0.3mm doesn't seem to affect practical usage.
